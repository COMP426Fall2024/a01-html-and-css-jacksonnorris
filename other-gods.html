The principal god, Ra, was the god of the sun, life, and creation. The Egyptians also believed that Ra was the first pharaoh of Egypt. Other notable Egyptian gods are Osiris, god of death; Isis, wife of Osiris; Horus, son of Osiris and Isis; Seth, god of War; Anubis, god of the dead; and Hapi, god of the flooding of the Nile. One of the most known Egyptian myths is that of Osiris, who was a king of Egypt that got murdered and then dismembered by his brother, Seth. Isis, his wife, reassembled his body and resurrected Osiris, enabling them to have and heir, Horus.</p></div>`;

One of the versions of their creation myth involves Quetzalcoatl, who brings about a fifth coming of the sun (similar to an era) that allows human civilization in the current era to begin. The Aztec patron god Huitzilopochtli was the god of war and sacrifice, who was believed to need daily human sacrifice to be satisfied. In this ritual, the sacrifical victim would have their heart torn out while still beating and held up to the sky.</p></div>`;

According to Norse mythology, Odin hung upside-down for nine days from the tree Yggdrasil in order to learn of the runic alphabet, which he then gave to humans. Odin's wife, Frigg, can see the future, yet does not tell anyone. Their beloved son, Baldr, had dreams of his impending death, which is then engineered by the god Loki. Loki is imprisoned for this action but is foretold to break free one day and go to war against the gods. This war is a part of Ragnar√∂k, a series of impending events, during which Loki's children will help destroy all but two humans.</p></div>`;
