The principal god, Ra, was the god of the sun, life, and creation. The Egyptians also believed that Ra was the first pharaoh of Egypt. Other notable Egyptian gods are Osiris, god of death; Isis, wife of Osiris; Horus, son of Osiris and Isis; Seth, god of War; Anubis, god of the dead; and Hapi, god of the flooding of the Nile. One of the most known Egyptian myths is that of Osiris, who was a king of Egypt that got murdered and then dismembered by his brother, Seth. Isis, his wife, reassembled his body and resurrected Osiris, enabling them to have and heir, Horus.</div>`;
